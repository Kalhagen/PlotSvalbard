PlotSvalbard
======
**Plot research data from Svalbard on maps**

This is a developmental version of the *PlotSvalbard* package providing functions to plot research data from Svalbard on detailed and up-to-date maps that are not available in online databases. The package is developed by the Norwegian Polar Institute. Glacier fronts and land shapes of Kongsfjorden originate from July 2017.

As the package is in an early developmental phase, functions might not work as intended. Note that the package comes with absolutely no warranty and that maps generated by the package might be wrong. Any bug reports and code fixes are warmly welcomed. See *Contributions and contact information* for further details.

*PlotSvalbard* is based on [ggplot2][ggplot2] and the functions can be expanded using ggplot syntax.

Installation of the GitHub version
-------
Using the *devtools* package:
```{r}
library(devtools)
install_github("MikkoVihtakari/PlotSvalbard", dependencies = TRUE)
```

User Manual
-------
Examples on how to use the package are in the makings. A brief example below. 

### Making a simple interpolated map ###

```{r}
library(PlotSvalbard)
data(chlorophyll) ## load an example dataset

x <- interpolate(chlorophyll, Subset = "From <= 10", value = "Chla") ## Interpolate
plot(x, type = "kongsfjorden") ## Plot
```
